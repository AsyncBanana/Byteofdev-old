	<h2>Blog origins</h2>
	<p>
		I (AsyncBanana) created this blog for sharing my articles about web development and other forms
		of programming. It has started recently, and so it is still in heavy development.
	</p>
	<h2>Credits</h2>
	<p>
		Medium and CSS-Tricks have inspired many design elements for this blog. Additionally, WindiCSS,
		DaisyUI, and SvelteKit have been very helpful tools. Some of the icons are from FontAwesome
